This is a fullstack application that I have hosted with heroku. The purpose is to serve as a team-based issue resolution center. This allows users to create new issues, set deadlines, provide updates and collaborate on a solution all in real time.



The backend of this app is constructed with node.js and utilizes various dependencies. It comes complete with user authentication and authorization using JSON web tokens and uses mongoose to connect to the database created in MongoDB. All state is namahged with the Context API and functional components were used in order to implement react hooks throughout. The frontend was all written in React.js and combined with Materialize CSS.


Some of the dependencies: 

-Moment.JS for formatting timestamps
-bcrypt-js for hashing passwords
-JWT(JSON web tokens)
-Nodemon
-Concurrently
-Express/Express-validator
-uuid for generating unique id's
-axios
-mongoose
-config
-react-transition-group
